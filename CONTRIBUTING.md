# Contributing to claude-code-vector-memory

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-code-vector-memory.git
   cd claude-code-vector-memory
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_tests.sh
   python scripts/health_check.py
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add semantic search performance optimization"
   ```

### Coding Standards

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for functions and classes
- **Type Hints**: Include type hints for function parameters and returns
- **Error Handling**: Use appropriate exception handling with informative messages

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Add tests for new functionality in the `tests/` directory
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure changes work with the full system
- **Health Checks**: Verify system diagnostics still pass

Example test structure:
```python
def test_new_feature():
    """Test description of what this validates."""
    # Test implementation
    assert expected_result == actual_result
```

### Documentation

- **Update README.md** if adding new features or changing usage
- **Add docstrings** to new functions and classes
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
